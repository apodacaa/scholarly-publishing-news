      <description><![CDATA[The traditional article format is being reimagined to prioritize data-centric, reproducible, and machine-readable communication, shifting away from a static final object towards a dynamic, versioned, and deeply linked digital object grounded in data, workflows, and provenance. This change matters because it aims to address the limitations of the current system, such as limited reproducibility and visibility into data and methods, and to unlock new possibilities for integrity, accessibility, and ...]]></description>

This matters because it makes it harder for publishers and libraries to understand what content is valuable to their customers and patrons, hindering data-driven purchasing decisions.
